# BeneButton-Code
The code for the 3D printed button I made for my teacher.

The DFPlayer has pins 2 and 3 for its Serial Software communication.
It then outputs DACR and DACL to a pam8403 amplifier, which outputs the signal to two 4 Ohm 3 W Speakers.
The system is powered by a 3.7 V 1000 mAh lithium-ion battery.

The button pin is D7.
The langswitch is on D5.

Hope you can use this file for one of your own projects.
Good luck!
